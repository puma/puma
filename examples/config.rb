# === Puma control rack application ===

# Start the puma control rack application on “url”. This application can
# be communicated with to control the main server. Additionally, you can
# provide an authentication token, so all requests to the control server
# will need to include that token as a query parameter. This allows for
# simple authentication.
#
# Check out https://github.com/puma/puma/blob/master/lib/puma/app/status.rb
# to see what the app has available.
