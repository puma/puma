  # The methods that are available for use inside the configuration file.
  # These same methods are used in Puma cli and the rack handler
  # internally.
  #
  # Used manually (via CLI class):
  #
  #   config = Configuration.new({}) do |user_config|
  #     user_config.port 3001
  #   end
  #   config.load
  #
  #   puts config.options[:binds] # => "tcp://127.0.0.1:3001"
  #
  # Used to load file:
  #
  #   $ cat puma_config.rb
  #   port 3002
  #
  # Resulting configuration:
  #
  #   config = Configuration.new(config_file: "puma_config.rb")
  #   config.load
  #
  #   puts config.options[:binds] # => "tcp://127.0.0.1:3002"
  #
  # You can also find many examples being used by the test suite in
  # +test/config+.
  #
  # Puma v6 adds the option to specify a key name (String or Symbol) to the
  # hooks that run inside the forked workers.  All the hooks run inside the
  # {Puma::Cluster::Worker#run} method.
  #
  # Previously, the worker index and the LogWriter instance were passed to the
  # hook blocks/procs.  If a key name is specified, a hash is passed as the last
  # parameter.  This allows storage of data, typically objects that are created
  # before the worker that need to be passed to the hook when the worker is shutdown.
  #
  # The following hooks have been updated:
  #
  #     | DSL Method         |  Options Key            | Fork Block Location |
  #     | on_worker_boot     | :before_worker_boot     | inside, before      |
  #     | on_worker_shutdown | :before_worker_shutdown | inside, after       |
  #     | on_refork          | :before_refork          | inside              |

    #    protocol attached to it, will fall back to :socket
