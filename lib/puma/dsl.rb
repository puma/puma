module Puma
  # The methods that are available for use inside the config file.
  # These same methods are used in Puma cli and the rack handler
  # internally.
  #
  # Used manually (via CLI class):
  #
  #   config = Configuration.new({}) do |user_config|
  #     user_config.port 3001
  #   end
  #   config.load
  #
  #   puts config.options[:binds]
  #   "tcp://127.0.0.1:3001"
  #
  # Used to load file:
  #
  #   $ cat puma_config.rb
  #     port 3002
  #
  #   config = Configuration.new(config_file: "puma_config.rb")
  #   config.load
  #
  #   puts config.options[:binds]
  #   # => "tcp://127.0.0.1:3002"
