  # Each Puma "worker" has a thread pool to process requests.
  #
  # First a connection to a client is made in `Puma::Server`. It is wrapped in a
  # `Puma::Client` instance and then passed to the `Puma::Reactor` to ensure
  # the whole request is buffered into memory. Once the request is ready, it is passed into
  # a thread pool via the `Puma::ThreadPool#<<` operator where it is stored in a `@todo` array.
  #
  # Each thread in the pool has an internal loop where it pulls a request from the `@todo` array
  # and proceses it.

    # This method is used by `Puma::Server` to let the server know when
    # the thread pool can pull more requests from the socket and
    # pass to the reactor.
    #
    # The general idea is that the thread pool can only work on a fixed
    # number of requests at the same time. If it is already processing that
    # number of requests then it is at capacity. If another Puma process has
    # spare capacity, then the request can be left on the socket so the other
    # worker can pick it up and process it.
    #
    # For example: if there are 5 threads, but only 4 working on
    # requests, this method will not wait and the `Puma::Server`
    # can pull a request right away.
    #
    # If there are 5 threads and all 5 of them are busy, then it will
    # pause here, and wait until the `not_full` condition variable is
    # signaled, usually this indicates that a request has been processed.
    #
    # It's important to note that even though the server might accept another
    # request, it might not be added to the `@todo` array right away.
    # For example if a slow client has only sent a header, but not a body
    # then the `@todo` array would stay the same size as the reactor works
    # to try to buffer the request. In tha scenario the next call to this
    # method would not block and another request would be added into the reactor
    # by the server. This would continue until a fully bufferend request
    # makes it through the reactor and can then be processed by the thread pool.
