  #
  # The Reactor object is responsible for ensuring that a request has been
  # completely received before it starts to be processed. This may be known as read buffering.
  # If read buffering is not done, and no other read buffering is performed (such as by an application server
  # such as nginx) then the application would be subject to a slow client attack.
  #
  # Each Puma "worker" process has its own Reactor. For example if you start puma with `$ puma -w 5` then
  # it will have 5 workers and each worker will have it's own reactor.
  #
  # For a graphical representation of how the reactor works see [architecture.md](https://github.com/puma/puma/blob/master/docs/architecture.md#connection-pipeline).
  #
  # ## Reactor Flow
  #
  # A connection comes into a `Puma::Server` instance, it is then passed to a `Puma::Reactor` instance,
  # which stores it in an array and waits for any of the connections to be ready for reading.
  #
  # The waiting/wake up is performed with nio4r, which will use the apropriate backend (libev, Java NIO or
  # just plain IO#select). The call to `NIO::Selector#select` will "wake up" and
  # return the references to any objects that caused it to "wake". The reactor
  # then loops through each of these request objects, and sees if they're complete. If they
  # have a full header and body then the reactor passes the request to a thread pool.
  # Once in a thread pool, a "worker thread" can run the the application's Ruby code against the request.
  #
  # If the request is not complete, then it stays in the array, and the next time any
  # data is written to that socket reference, then the loop is woken up and it is checked for completeness again.
  #
  # A detailed example is given in the docs for `run_internal` which is where the bulk
  # of this logic lives.

    # Creates an instance of Puma::Reactor
    #
    # The `server` argument is an instance of `Puma::Server`
    # that is used to write a response for "low level errors"
    # when there is an exception inside of the reactor.
    #
    # The `app_pool` is an instance of `Puma::ThreadPool`.
    # Once a request is fully formed (header and body are received)
    # it will be passed to the `app_pool`.

    # Until a request is added via the `add` method this method will internally
    # loop, waiting on the `sockets` array objects. The only object in this
    # array at first is the `@ready` IO object, which is the read end of a pipe
    # connected to `@trigger` object. When `@trigger` is written to, then the loop
    # will break on `NIO::Selector#select` and return an array.
    #
    # ## When a request is added:
    #
    # When the `add` method is called, an instance of `Puma::Client` is added to the `@input` array.
    # Next the `@ready` pipe is "woken" by writing a string of `"*"` to `@trigger`.
    #
    # When that happens, the internal loop stops blocking at `NIO::Selector#select` and returns a reference
    # to whatever "woke" it up. On the very first loop, the only thing in `sockets` is `@ready`.
    # When `@trigger` is written-to, the loop "wakes" and the `ready`
    # variable returns an array of arrays that looks like `[[#<IO:fd 10>], [], []]` where the
    # first IO object is the `@ready` object. This first array `[#<IO:fd 10>]`
    # is saved as a `reads` variable.
    #
    # The `reads` variable is iterated through. In the case that the object
    # is the same as the `@ready` input pipe, then we know that there was a `trigger` event.
    #
    # If there was a trigger event, then one byte of `@ready` is read into memory. In the case of the first request,
    # the reactor sees that it's a `"*"` value and the reactor adds the contents of `@input` into the `sockets` array.
    # The while then loop continues to iterate again, but now the `sockets` array contains a `Puma::Client` instance in addition
    # to the `@ready` IO object. For example: `[#<IO:fd 10>, #<Puma::Client:0x3fdc1103bee8 @ready=false>]`.
    #
    # Since the `Puma::Client` in this example has data that has not been read yet,
    # the `NIO::Selector#select` is immediately able to "wake" and read from the `Puma::Client`. At this point the
    # `ready` output looks like this: `[[#<Puma::Client:0x3fdc1103bee8 @ready=false>], [], []]`.
    #
    # Each element in the first entry is iterated over. The `Puma::Client` object is not
    # the `@ready` pipe, so the reactor checks to see if it has the full header and body with
    # the `Puma::Client#try_to_finish` method. If the full request has been sent,
    # then the request is passed off to the `@app_pool` thread pool so that a "worker thread"
    # can pick up the request and begin to execute application logic. This is done
    # via `@app_pool << c`. The `Puma::Client` is then removed from the `sockets` array.
    #
    # If the request body is not present then nothing will happen, and the loop will iterate
    # again. When the client sends more data to the socket the `Puma::Client` object will
    # wake up the `NIO::Selector#select` and it can again be checked to see if it's ready to be
    # passed to the thread pool.
    #
    # ## Time Out Case
    #
    # In addition to being woken via a write to one of the sockets the `NIO::Selector#select` will
    # periodically "time out" of the sleep. One of the functions of this is to check for
    # any requests that have "timed out". At the end of the loop it's checked to see if
    # the first element in the `@timeout` array has exceed its allowed time. If so,
    # the client object is removed from the timeout array, a 408 response is written.
    # Then its connection is closed, and the object is removed from the `sockets` array
    # that watches for new data.
    #
    # This behavior loops until all the objects that have timed out have been removed.
    #
    # Once all the timeouts have been processed, the next duration of the `NIO::Selector#select` sleep
    # will be set to be equal to the amount of time it will take for the next timeout to occur.
    # This calculation happens in `calculate_sleep`.
