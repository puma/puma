  # any monitored object either receives data or times out, or when the Reactor shuts down.

  # The waiting/wake up is performed with nio4r, which will use the appropriate backend (libev,
  # Java NIO or just plain IO#select). The call to `NIO::Selector#select` will
  # 'wakeup' any IO object that receives data.
  #
  # This class additionally tracks a timeout for every added object,
  # and wakes up any object when its timeout elapses.
