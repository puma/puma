v0.3.3. Properly display package/gem version for mongrel_service; Closes #13823. Updated ServiceFB to r80 to solve issue when compiling with FB > 0.17.
    
v0.3.2. Solved detection of parent process at ServiceFB level (solves the x64 Windows issues). Upgraded to ServiceFB 'trunk' (but pistoned it, just in case). Fixed problems with ruby installations outside PATH or inside folders with spaces. Activate FB pedantic warnings by default (is really useful).
    
v0.3.1. Single Service (SingleMongrel) object type implemented. Updated Rakefile to reflect the new building steps. Removed SendSignal, too hackish for my taste, replaced with complete FB solution. Added basic Process monitoring and re-spawning.
